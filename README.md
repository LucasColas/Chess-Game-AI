# Chess-Game

New chess game. Game made with Kivy and aimed to be cross platform.

The AI is not implemented yet. But you can play with another friend ;)

There are still some issues (related to the algorithm to check a checkmate). I will fix them soon.
Moreover there are 2 special moves (Pawn promotion and en passant) not implemented yet.

# Install 
You'll need Python and [kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html). Kivy is an Open Source Python App Development Framework. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LucasColas/Chess-Game-Kivy.git
```

cd Chess-Game-Kivy
```
